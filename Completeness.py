#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
#   Purpose:
#   Creating a 'Completeness Report' based on Range Exports from TST environment. This class 
#   will look at specific fields in the TST.accdb file and calculate the percentage of how many 
#   non-null / total entries seen in these specific fields. These fields are similar to what we see 
#   on the demographic and lab tabs of WebCMR. 
#   
#   Algorithm:
#       1. Create a database connection to .accdb file
#       2. Construct 2 queries. One to get information related to Demographic tab 
#          and another for information from Laboratory tab
#       3. Calculate the total of non_missing values over the complete total for that specific field
#          for all fields
#       4. Put values into a dataframe with percentages and export it as a .xlsx file
#       5. Done
